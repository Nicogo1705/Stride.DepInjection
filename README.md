# Stride.DependencyInjection

## Overview

Stride.DependencyInjection is a lightweight library that allows for dependency injection in ScriptComponent classes using a single attribute (Inject).

## Features

- **Simplicity**: Inject dependencies into your EntityComponent classes with just one attribute.
- **Lightweight**: The source code is short and straightforward, making it easy to maintain and extend.

## Usage

To use Stride.DependencyInjection, First register your types, then simply add the provided attribute to each property that you want to inject. 
NOTE : property must have Get & set and being public.
The library will handle the rest.
